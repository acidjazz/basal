## intoduction

basal is a tool to help allow dynamic content on static sites, cutting out out the need for databases, server-side rendering, or even servers (ex: S3 statically hosted sites). basal also provides a customizable look and feel for you and others (client, partners, etc) to modify this content.

## usage

* Create a `Structure`, this defines the structure of your content with entities, maybe it be `Text`, an `Image`, or even a `Blog` 
* Add an `Entry` or two to that structure, being your actual content
* Incorporate basal into your site to display the added content, this can be done through basals' JavaScript library or hitting the API (other libraries are actively in development)
